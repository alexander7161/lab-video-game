# Frameworks

## Laravel

We used the laravel framework to create our website. It made it easier for us to use a model-view-controller architecture. We also used it for local development so we didn't have to use code envy because it was too slow. We also used the laravel authentication bootstrap. It was really helpful in that it came with a function to encrypt passwords.

## Bootstrap

We used bootstrap to unify our UI and make it look nice. It also made it easy to make our website usable on mobile.

## Heroku

We hosted our site on heroku as it provides continuous deployment from the master branch of our repository.
We also used postgreSQL because it is the only free SQL option with heroku.
